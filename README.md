ENPIRE is a harness for coding agents to improve robot policies through
repeatable real-world experiments. Agents propose changes, evaluate them on a
physical station, inspect measurements and recordings, and use that evidence
to guide the next iteration.

The framework connects four modules:

- **Environment (EN):** reset the scene and verify task outcomes.
- **Policy Improvement (PI):** Iteratively improve performance via different learning paradigms (RL, BC, Heuristic Learning, etc.)
- **Rollout (R):** evaluate policies on one or more robots.
- **Evolution (E):** analyze failures, develop hypotheses, and improve the next experiment.

Together, they form the loop **reset → execute → verify → record → refine**.
Code-as-Policy (CaP) supports heuristic learning through Python skill scripts;
the real-world RL environment supports neural policy training with an
actor/learner pipeline. Both use the station's robot, perception, and calibration tools.

## Quick Start

### Run with a coding agent

Launch a coding agent and give it the following prompt:

```text
Clone https://github.com/NVlabs/ENPIRE.git with submodules and read AGENTS.md.
Follow enpire/env/docs/INSTALL.md and run 00_hello_environment.
Use the existing configured environment when one is provided.
Summarize the available tools and task entry points.
For real-robot work, follow enpire/env/docs/REAL_WORLD_WORKFLOWS.md:
complete station and calibration preflight, and obtain explicit motion authorization.
```

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) describes the repository layout, implementation rules,
and environment ownership. The [auto-research instructions](enpire/policy/autoresearch_instruction.md)
define the experiment loop and the reset, verification, and safety boundaries
that a policy researcher must preserve.

### Manual setup

Requires Python 3.11 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Start with the
hardware-free example:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NVlabs/ENPIRE.git
cd ENPIRE
uv sync --extra dev
uv run enpire examples run 00_hello_environment
```

For an existing checkout, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` before
using uv. The [installation guide](enpire/env/docs/INSTALL.md) covers hardware
extras; `uv sync` replaces the selected extras, so include all required extras
in one invocation.

Real-robot runs require a registered station, calibrated cameras and robot
transforms, and the task's perception and control services. Follow the
[station and task workflow](enpire/env/docs/REAL_WORLD_WORKFLOWS.md) for setup.
The [real-world RL environment](enpire/policy/pld/runtime/README.md) uses an
isolated dependency project for its actor and learner.

### Set up a custom real-world environment for auto-research

For each environment, the user must provide a **reset function** and a
**reward/verification function**, using CaP or other task-specific scripts.
A coding agent can help write and validate these during environment setup.
The [project website](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/gear/enpire/) illustrates
physical resets for Push-T, pin insertion, GPU insertion, and zip-tie tasks,
along with vision-based reward evaluation.

1. **Prepare the station.** Register the robot and cameras, calibrate the station,
   and start the required services using the
   [real-world setup guide](enpire/env/docs/REAL_WORLD_WORKFLOWS.md).
2. **Define and validate the environment.** Specify observations and actions.
   Write a reset that restores the scene and checks readiness, and a reward
   function that scores progress or success from camera images, robot state,
   or contact measurements. Follow the [task guide](enpire/env/docs/NEW_TASK.md)
   for script templates and task registration.
3. **Run auto-research.** Validate repeated reset and evaluation cycles on the
   real station, then keep reset, reward, verification, and safety rules fixed
   while the agent improves policy or training code. Set a trial budget and
   retain outcomes, logs, and videos as described in the
   [auto-research contract](enpire/policy/autoresearch_instruction.md).

Examples to build from:

- [Hello environment](enpire/env/examples/00_hello_environment/README.md): a minimal reset–execute–verify loop.
- [Simulated Push-T](enpire/env/examples/20_simulated_pusht/README.md): a hardware-free 2D Push-T physics task.
- [Real object pickup](enpire/env/examples/10_real_object_pick/README.md): CaP composition of perception, planning, and robot control.
- [Push-T](enpire/env/docs/NEW_TASK.md#push-t-reference-implementation): a physical reset workflow and heuristic policy improvement.
