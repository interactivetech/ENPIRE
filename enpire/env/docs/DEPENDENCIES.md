# ENPIRE dependencies

ENPIRE uses Python 3.11 and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). Exact
versions are defined by [`pyproject.toml`](../../../pyproject.toml) and
[`uv.lock`](../../../uv.lock). The PLD learner has an isolated environment at
[`enpire/policy/pld/runtime`](../../policy/pld/runtime/pyproject.toml).

## Install

See [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) — it is the single source for the clone-with-
submodules step and the extras matrix. This file covers what those dependencies
*are*, not how to install them.

## Required system software

- Linux x86-64, Git, Git LFS, tmux, FFmpeg, curl, and uv.
- SocketCAN/udev support for YAM hardware.
- NVIDIA driver for cuRobo, local vision, AnyGrasp, or PLD. A *system* CUDA
  toolkit is not required for cuRobo — `nvidia-curobo[cu12]` installs its own
  toolchain as wheels (see [`CUROBO_SETUP.md`](CUROBO_SETUP.md)). Building the
  AnyGrasp SDK yourself does need a local toolkit.
- Librealsense-compatible host support or the ZED SDK for those cameras.

## Important compatibility pins

- Python `>=3.11,<3.12`
- Warp `==1.12.0` for the vendored cuRobo API
- RealSense Python `==2.56.5.9235`
- Mink `==0.0.12`; yourdfpy `==0.0.59`
- PLD JAX/JAXlib `==0.6.1`, NumPy `<2`, protobuf `==5.29.6`

## Not stored in Git

API keys, W&B/Hugging Face credentials, datasets, checkpoints, SAM3 weights,
the licensed AnyGrasp SDK/checkpoint/license, BundleSDF weights, generated udev
rules, and station-specific calibrated XML/URDF files remain external. Reusable
YAM/Fello models and redistributable source code are included in this repository.
